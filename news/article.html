                    We live in an unfavourable economy, one where there is always a constant need to make ends meet. This singular desire and the recognition that the contemporary society attach to making money and living above the average standard has caused roughly 85% of her citizens to place so much focus on working either for the pay or the fun.
            A job is simply seen as the work one does to make money or a task which one carries out in order to earn money. In other words, a career is a profession that one does for a long period of their life, it automatically becomes an intrinsic part of their lives. In career, each of your jobs, experience and training program helps you advance in pay or responsibility.
            The key difference between a job and a career is your attitude, this means that one who wants a career is always out, thinking about the long term goals and things to achieve in the long run.
            According to an online blog post, a job is more short-term oriented and tends to focus purely on earning money. On the other hand, a career is a series of related employment in one field that provides experience for your future and helps you earn a better paycheck and living status. Below are examples of careers;
            ·         Market Research Analyst
            ·         Epidemiologist
            ·         Occupational Therapist
            ·         Software Developers
                Examples of jobs are;
            ·         Waiters and waitresses
            ·         Customer service representatives
            ·         Material movers
            ·         Office clerks or Cashiers etc
            
            THE KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A JOB AND CAREER ARE:
            ·         Professional Growth:
            A job compared to career presents less professional growth opportunity and recognition for you especially thinking about both concepts long term. Specialised training and other self-development skills training are aimed at contributing to your lifelong pursuit in the chosen career field. 
            A career presents you with more opportunities for professional growth as well as a chance to become a thought leader and specialist in your field. A job, on the other hand, presents you with an opportunity to earn your next pay and very low or non-existent career progression opportunities.
             ·         A Journey:
            A job is not a lifelong journey but an immediate hustle with the sole end goal of the pay while a career is a journey. A career journey as defined by Oxford dictionary is a long and often difficult process of personal change and development. 
            ·         Less Fulfilment:
            A job guarantees less professional fulfilment while a career will ensure you are more fulfilled in terms of career goals and personal achievements. Professional recognition, achievements, awards and rewards are more likeable to be awarded to you for a career than for a job.
            People with a career usually come into work on Mondays happier than those on a job. This is simply because career routines feel less boring to them and it’s a launchpad to their future goals.
            It is also important to understand that if you are at the start of your career, try not to get stuck doing a job for purely monetary gains. Building a career is a lot of work and takes commitment but it is more rewarding financially and in the long run, helps you develop your leadership skills, positions you more as an industry leader than a job. In conclusion, take an audit of your professional life and decide which path you’re on if it suits you or not and most importantly make required changes if needed.
